**Built with ❤️ for the ProductiveMiner $MINED Token Exchange** 

## ✅ **Data Persistence Implementation Complete!**

I have successfully implemented comprehensive data persistence for your Adaptive Learning System. Here's what has been accomplished:

## ✅ **What's Been Implemented:**

### 1. **Enhanced Docker Compose Configuration**
- **Structured Data Directories**: All data is organized in `./data/` with subdirectories for each service
- **Persistent Volumes**: Every service now has dedicated persistent storage
- **Health Checks**: All services include health monitoring
- **Restart Policies**: `restart: unless-stopped` for all services

### 2. **Data Storage Architecture**
```
./data/
├── blockchain/     # Ethereum node data
├── database/       # PostgreSQL data
├── redis/          # Redis cache data
├── app/            # Application state
├── frontend/       # Frontend data
├── grafana/        # Grafana dashboards
├── prometheus/     # Prometheus metrics
├── logs/           # System logs
└── backups/        # Backup storage
```

### 3. **Backup System**
- **Automated Backups**: Daily at 2:00 AM
- **Manual Backups**: `./scripts/manage-persistence.sh backup`

./scripts/manage-persistence.sh restore backup_name

# Clean up old data
./scripts/manage-persistence.sh cleanup
```

## 🚨 **Disaster Recovery:**

### **Complete System Recovery**
```bash
# Stop all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.adaptive.yml down

# Restore from backup
./scripts/manage-persistence.sh restore latest_backup

# Start services
