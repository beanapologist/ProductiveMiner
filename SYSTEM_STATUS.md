# 🟢 System Status: All Systems Operational

## ✅ **Connection Issues Resolved**

The "localhost refused to connect" error has been fixed. The system is now running properly on the correct ports.

## 🌐 **Service Status**

| Service | Port | Status | URL |
|---------|------|--------|-----|
| **Backend API** | 3000 | ✅ Running | http://localhost:3000 |
| **Frontend App** | 3001 | ✅ Running | http://localhost:3001 |
| **Blockchain (Ganache)** | 8545 | ✅ Running | http://localhost:8545 |

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

1. **Port Conflict Resolution**: Backend and frontend were trying to use the same port (3000)
2. **Process Management**: Killed conflicting processes and restarted services properly
3. **Port Assignment**: 
   - Backend: Port 3000 (API server)
   - Frontend: Port 3001 (React app)
   - Blockchain: Port 8545 (Ganache)

## 🧪 **Test Results**

All genesis block and persistence tests are passing:

✅ **Block Height**: 0 (genesis block)  
✅ **Trading Volume**: 0 (correct for genesis)  
✅ **Active Miners**: 0 (correct for genesis)  
✅ **Trading Price**: $0.85 (genesis price)  
✅ **Blockchain Health**: Connected and mining  
✅ **Validators**: 0 validators at genesis  
✅ **Discoveries**: 0 discoveries at genesis  
✅ **Blocks Endpoint**: Returns genesis block only  

## 🚀 **How to Access**

1. **Frontend Application**: http://localhost:3001
2. **Backend API**: http://localhost:3000
3. **API Health Check**: http://localhost:3000/health
4. **Blockchain Status**: http://localhost:3000/api/status

## 📊 **Current State**

- **Blockchain**: At genesis block (height 0)
- **Mining**: Active and ready
- **Frontend**: Properly reset to genesis state
- **Block Persistence**: Working correctly
- **All Services**: Running and synchronized

## 🔄 **Next Steps**

1. Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser
2. The frontend will show the correct genesis block state
3. As blocks are mined, the system will track and display growth
4. All metrics will scale progressively with blockchain activity

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

If you encounter connection issues again:

1. **Check if services are running**:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep -E "(node|ganache)" | grep -v grep
   ```

2. **Check port usage**:
   ```bash
   lsof -i :3000
   lsof -i :3001
   ```

3. **Restart services**:
   ```bash
   # Kill all node processes
   pkill -f "node"
   
   # Restart backend
   node index.js &
   
   # Restart frontend
   cd frontend && PORT=3001 npm start &
   ```

The system is now fully operational and ready for use! 🎉
